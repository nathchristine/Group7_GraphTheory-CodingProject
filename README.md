## Travelling Salesman Problem
### Main Function

```
  int v, e, start;
  cin >> v >> e;
```
* Make a variable for the number of vertices/nodes, edges, and the starting (and ending) point then scan vertices/nodes and edge.

```
vector<pair<int, int> > graph[v];
  for (int i = 0; i < v; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j < v; j++) {
      graph[i].push_back({INT_MAX, -1});
    }
  }
```
* Make an adjacency list for the graph and initialize the weight and name.

```
for (int i = 0; i < e; i++) {
    int ver1, ver2, weight, name;
    cin >> name >> ver1 >> ver2 >> weight;

    if (graph[ver1-1][ver2-1].first > weight && graph[ver2-1][ver1-1].first > weight) {
      graph[ver1-1][ver2-1].first = weight;
      graph[ver2-1][ver1-1].first = weight;
      graph[ver1-1][ver2-1].second = name;
      graph[ver2-1][ver1-1].second = name;
    } 
  }
```
* Read the vertices, weight, name as many as the number of edges from the input and add them to the graph.
* Updates the graph to store the minimum weight for the edge between ver1 and ver2 while also updating the name to the edge.

```
cin >> start;
tsp(start-1, v, graph);
```
* Reads the starting vertex start and calls the tsp function to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem
<br>

### TSP Function
```
void tsp (int start, int v, vector<pair<int, int> > graph[])
```
* This function takes three parameters: the starting vertex `start`, the number of vertices `v`, and the adjacency list `graph`

```
vector<int> vertex; 
  for (int i = 0; i < v; i++) {
    if (i != start) {
      vertex.push_back(i);
    }
  }
```
* Store all vertex, except the starting vertex, in a new vector.


```
int min_cost = INT_MAX;
vector<int> best_route;
```
* Variables to store the smallest cost and its route.

```
do {
      int current_cost = 0;
      vector<int> current_route;

      int k = start;

      for (int i = 0; i < vertex.size(); i++) {
        current_cost += graph[k][vertex[i]].first;
        current_route.push_back(graph[k][vertex[i]].second);
        k = vertex[i];
      }

      current_cost += graph[k][start].first;
      current_route.push_back(graph[k][start].second);

      if (current_cost < min_cost) {
          min_cost = current_cost;
          best_route = current_route;
      }
  } while (next_permutation(vertex.begin(), vertex.end()));
```
* The Do-While loop generates all possible permutations of the vertices excluding the starting vertex.
* Store the cost and route of each permutation in `current_cost` and `current_route`.
* The inner for loop iterates through the vertices in the current permutation starting from `k` which was set to the starting vertex:
    * Adds the weight of the edge from the current vertex `k` to the next vertex `vetrex[i]` in the permutation to `current_cost` and the name of the edge to `current_route`.
    * Update `k` to the next vertex `vetrex[i]` in the permutation.
* After the for loop completes, adds the weight of the edge from the last vertex in the permutation back to the starting vertex to `current_cost` and adds the name of this edge to `current_route`.
* Check if the current permutation cost less `min_cost` found so far.
    *  If it is, update `min_cost` to `current_cost`, and `best_route` to `current_route`.
* Continue to generate the next permutation of the vertices using the `next_permutation`.

```
cout << "Cost: " << min_cost << endl;
  cout << "Route: ";
  for (int i = 0; i < best_route.size(); i++) {
      cout << best_route[i];
      if (i < best_route.size() - 1) {
          cout << ", ";
      }
  }
```
* After all permutation have been evaluated, print the smallest cost and best route.

## Knight Tour

```
bool isValidMove(int x, int y, int rows, int cols, vector<vector<bool>> &visited) {
    //To ensure the moves are still inclusive of the chessboard area
    return (x >= 0 && x < rows && y >= 0 && y < cols && !visited[x][y]);
}
```
This function verifies if the knight's move stays within the board boundaries (within the given rows and columns) and ensures the square hasn't been visited yet. If both conditions are met, it returns `true`.

```
bool backtrack(int x, int y, int moveCount, int rows, int cols, vector<vector<bool>> &visited, vector<pair<int, int>> &path, vector<pair<int, int>> &moves) {
    //To keep track of the Visited Coordinates
    visited[x][y] = true;  
    path.push_back({x, y});  
    
    // "-1" from total (rows * cols) because the 24th move visits the last coordinate
    if (moveCount == rows * cols - 1) {
        return true;  
    }
    
    //Recursively goes through all possible movements
    for (auto move : moves) {
        int newX = x + move.first;
        int newY = y + move.second;
        if (isValidMove(newX, newY, rows, cols, visited)) {
            if (backtrack(newX, newY, moveCount + 1, rows, cols, visited, path, moves)) {
                return true; 
            }
        }
    }
    
    //If no movements introduce a different coordinate
    visited[x][y] = false;
    path.pop_back();
    return false; 
}

```
This function serves to move the knight around the chessboard. It starts by marking the current square as visited `(x,y)` and puts it in a path. The function then checks to see if the knight has visited every square on the board. If that is the case, then it returns true, which means a valid solution has been found.

If not, the function goes through all the possible moves the knight can make. For each move, it calculates the new position and uses the isValidMove function to check if it's a valid move. If the move is valid, the function calls itself to keep exploring that path.

If any of these recursive calls lead to a solution, it returns true. If none of the moves work, the function backtracks by unmarked the square and removing it from the path before trying other moves.

```
vector<pair<int, int>> knightTourAnticlockwise(int rows, int cols, int startX, int startY) {
    //The order of movements in an "anticlockwise" manner
    vector<pair<int, int>> moves = {
        {2, -1}, {1, -2}, 
        {-1, -2}, {-2, -1}, 
        {-2, 1}, {-1, 2}, 
        {1, 2}, {2, 1}
    };
    
    //Initiating visited coordinates and path
    vector<vector<bool>> visited(rows, vector<bool>(cols, false));
    vector<pair<int, int>> path;

    backtrack(startX, startY, 0, rows, cols, visited, path, moves);

    return path; 
}
```

This function aims to move the knight counterclockwise around the chessboard. It makes use of a `moves` vector, which starts in the right side of the chessboard and moves counterclockwise to list every possible knight move. A visited matrix, which indicates the squares that have already been visited, is used to record the knight's progress.

The 'backtrack' method, which starts from the original point and looks for a legitimate path for the knight, is the central component of the function. It examines possible moves recursively and turns around if a move results in a dead end. Once a complete path is found, the function returns it.

```
int main() {
    int rows, cols, startX, startY;

    cin >> rows;
    cin >> cols;

    cin >> startX;
    cin >> startY;

    vector<pair<int, int>> result = knightTourAnticlockwise(rows, cols, startX, startY);

    for (auto coordinate : result) {
        cout << coordinate.first << ' ' << coordinate.second << endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

Finally, the program executes in the main function. It accepts input for the knight's starting location (`startX`, `startY`) and board size (`rows`, `cols`). Additionally, the `knightTourActiclockwise` function determines the knight's tour oath, and the path (coordinates) the knight has followed is then printed out.


## Chinese Postman Problem
  
  <img width="518" alt="Screenshot 2024-10-07 at 18 36 26" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2237a712-a1ee-4d43-95ff-e3b29020b87e">

  ### Steps
  * Step 1: At first, we will list all the odd-degree vertices of the graph.
  * Step 2: Now, we will list all the possible pairs of the odd vertices, which means all of them...
  * Step 3: For each odd pairing, find the edge that connects the vertices with the minimum or least weight.
  * Step 4: Then, we will find the pairings so that the sum of the weights of the edges is minimized.
  * Step 5: Now, On the original graph, we will add the edges that have been found in Step 4.
  * Step 6: The length of an optimal Chinese postman or route inspection path is the sum of all the edges of the graph added to the total   found in Step 4.
  * Step 7: Finally, we can find the route corresponding to this minimum sum path can then be easily found.

  1 - 2 = 10 <br>
  1 - 3 = 2 <br>
  1 - 3 = 7 <br>
  2 - 3 = 5 <br>
  
  hence the minimum, or least weight would be 1 - 3 (edge 3), with the cost of 2

  ### Code

  ```
  void dfs(int v) {
    if (mark[v]) return;
    mark[v] = true;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (a[v][i] < INF)
            dfs(i);
    }
  }
```

This DFS function checks whether the graph is connected by visiting all reachable nodes from a starting point.This will ensure that the graph is solvable becauuse eulerian circuit or path requires a connected graph

```
int rec(int mask) {
    int &res = mem[mask];
    if (res != -1) return res;
    if (mask == 0) return res = 0;
    res = INF;
    int i1;
    for (i1 = 0; (mask & (1 << i1)) == 0; i1++);
    for (int i2 = i1 + 1; i2 < n; i2++) {
        if (mask & (1 << i2)) {
            int newCost = d[i1][i2] + rec(mask ^ (1 << i1) ^ (1 << i2));
            if (newCost < res) {
                res = newCost;
            }
        }
    }
    return res;
}
```

This function's purpose is to match nodes with odd degrees in pairs to minimize the additional cost required to make all degrees even a necessary condition for an Eulerian path/circuit. As stated in step 6.

```
oid reconstructPath(int u, int v) {
    if (d[u][v] == a[u][v]) {
        for (auto &[cost, edgeId] : edgeMap[{min(u, v), max(u, v)}]) {
            if (cost == a[u][v]) {
                edgeSequence.push_back(edgeId);
                break;
            }
        }
    } else {
        for (int k = 0; k < n; k++) {
            if (d[u][v] == d[u][k] + d[k][v]) {
                reconstructPath(u, k);
                reconstructPath(k, v);
                return;
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Selects the shortest path between nodes u and v into direct edges and keeps track of their ids. This allows the program to determine the exact sequence of edges that make up the path, for the final output of the edges used in the optimal solution.

```
for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
    int edgeId, x, y, c;
    cin >> edgeId >> x >> y >> c;
    x--; y--;
    a[x][y] = min(a[x][y], c);
    a[y][x] = min(a[y][x], c);
    sum += c;
    deg[x]++, deg[y]++;
    edgeMap[{min(x, y), max(x, y)}].push_back({c, edgeId});
}
```

This is the user input section, the input will be amount of nodes, amount of edges, edge id, the nodes connected, and cost, lastly the starting and end node of the graph.

```
memcpy(d, a, sizeof a);
for (int k = 0; k < n; k++) {
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            d[i][j] = min(d[i][j], d[i][k] + d[k][j]);
        }
    }
}
```

this section computes all-pairs shortest paths using the Floyd-Warshall algorithm

```
cout << res << "\n";
edgeSequence.clear();
for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    for (int j = i + 1; j < n; j++) {
        if ((deg[i] % 2 == 1) && (deg[j] % 2 == 1)) {
            reconstructPath(i, j);
        }
    }
}

cout << "Edges: ";
for (int edge : edgeSequence) {
    cout << edge << " ";
}
cout << "\n";
```

Lastly, the main function
